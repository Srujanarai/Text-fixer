This project presents an automated word correction system that suggests probable corrections for misspelled words based on edit distance and word frequency probability.


The word correction system integrates word frequency analysis from a corpus of
valid words and an edit distance algorithm to suggest corrections for misspelled
words. The methodology follows these key steps:

- Data Collection and Final.txt: In this project, the primary data source for valid
words comes from the final.txt file, which is a custom text dataset. This file
contains a large number of words or text that the system will use to build its
wordlist for correction suggestions. The file is read, and the text is preprocessed
by converting all words to lowercase and using regular expressions to extract
alphanumeric words, ignoring punctuation and other non-word characters.

- Word Frequency Calculation: After extracting words from final.txt, the system
calculates the frequency of each word using Pythonâ€™s Counter class from the
collections module. This step helps to understand how often each word appears
in the dataset. The probability of each word is determined by dividing its
frequency bythe total number of words, assigning more frequent words higher
probabilities.

- Edit Distance Algorithm: The system uses an edit distance function to find
candidate corrections for a misspelled word. The algorithm considers simple
character-level edits such as insertions, deletions, substitutions, and
transpositionsof letters. These one-character edits are used to generate possible
correction candidates.

- Combining Word Frequency and Edit Distance: The candidate corrections
generated by the edit distance algorithm are ranked by their probability of being
the correct word. This ranking combines both the proximity of the candidate
word to the input (based on edit distance) and the likelihood of the word's
occurrence inthe dataset (based on word frequency).

- Output Generation: The top correction suggestions are displayed to the user.
Thesuggestions are sorted based on their probability, ensuring that the most
likely corrections are presented first. This method enhances the accuracy of the
word correction system and provides relevant suggestions to the user.
By using final.txt as the main word dataset, the system tailors the correction
process to the specific language or context represented in that file, ensuring
moreaccurate suggestions in line with the source text.
